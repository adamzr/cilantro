Chrome extension that lets you quickly post (and share links to) to [Avocado](https://avocado.io).

Uses [Avcado's API](https://avocado.io/guacamole/avocado-api) to post. For credentials, it uses the account that you're currently signed into the browser with.

When sharing from a [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) tab, the currently selected item's link is used instead.

Available in the Chrome Web Store at [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkfoaclholjephhdhmaoeabajfnbeheo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkfoaclholjephhdhmaoeabajfnbeheo).
